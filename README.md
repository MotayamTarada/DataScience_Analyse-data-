•	Using the unified_price, find the maximum price reached during this period and for which commodity for both:
o	commodities measured by weight
o	commodities measured by volume
Instructions:
Create a notebook with a clear markdown cell with your name and ID, and:
•	For each question, your answer should consist of:
o	The question
o	The code cell(s) required to solve the question
o	Markdown cell containing interpretation of the results if applicable.
•	Your notebook should be clean, organized, and does not contain unused or redundant code
•	You have to submit the notebook in .ipynb format. Other extensions such as .py .txt .html are not acceptable
